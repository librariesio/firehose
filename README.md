# Libraries Firehose

Server sent event bridge for the [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) events firehose.

## Event timing

The Libraries.io events firehose allows you to consume new upstream release
events in near-realtime.

The main [libraries.io dispatch
application](https://libraries.io/github/librariesio/dispatch) polls several
upstream repository feeds every 30 seconds. For GitHub specifically, the
dispatch app watches the [server-sent event stream for
GitHub](https://github.com/librariesio/github-firehose).

Your new release event should show up in the libraries.io firehose in less than
one minute, although the [GitHub Event API is delayed by five
minutes](https://github.blog/changelog/2018-08-01-new-delay-public-events-api/).
